# Saccade_detector
This is a matlab tool for eye-movement analysis

The saccade detection method is introduced in the comments of 'saccade_detector.m' function.

You can either use this function to detect saccade or micro-saccades, by setting appropriate parameters.

Use the GUI (run the 'RUN_GUI.m') to find the parameter values which suit your data the best. 
（Try the 'example_eyetrace_data.mat' firstly. It contains a saccade and some micro-saccades.）

Good Luck！
